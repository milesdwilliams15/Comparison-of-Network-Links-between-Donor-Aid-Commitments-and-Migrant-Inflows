# Comparison of Network Links between Donor Aid Commitments and Migrant-Inflows

## A Network Analysis

For d = 18 OECD Members, Pearson's correlation coefficient is estimated for aid commitments from d_1 and d_n to a given aid recipient (a non-member state of the OECD) and for migrant inflows from a given aid recipient to d_1 and d_n. 

An example of the equation used to estimate Pearson's r for bilateral aid commitments between donors is shown below.

Following estimation of each pairwise correlation coefficient, the results are placed within a network analytic model where each node in the network to be mapped is a given donor and where the width and transparency of the links between nodes is proportional to the strength of the estimated pairwise correlation.
